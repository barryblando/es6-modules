/**
 * Proxy allows overwrite default behavior of an operation or existing properties in an object
 * </reference https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy
 * Proxy takes two things, target which an object would you like to proxy and handler where you specify all of the operations which you wish to rewrite
 * when you overwrite default operations or each thing inside the handle those things are called 'traps', what it does is it sits between you and the object.
